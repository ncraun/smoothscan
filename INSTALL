smoothscan 0.1.0

Dependencies
------------

Please install the following dependencies before smoothscan.

leptonica: http://leptonica.com/
libharu: http://libharu.org/
potrace: http://potrace.sourceforge.net/
fontforge (compiled w/ python support): http://fontforge.org/
python: http://www.python.org/

In order for leptonica to be able to read and write image formats, you
will have to install the library for that particular image format. See
the leptonica documentation for more info. In order for smoothscan to
work properly, leptonica must be compiled with at least tiff and png
support.

autotrace can be used in place of potrace, but potrace generally
produces better quality vectorizations.

Downloading
-----------

First make sure you always download the latest version of the
software. You can get it from the project's homepage at

Installation
------------

Installation follows the standard GNU Autotools procedure:

sudo make install

see configure --help for more information on options.

Pay attention to the output from configure. It will warn you if you
are missing any dependencies or if any problems were encountered with
the build.
